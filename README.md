# so-cards

A serverless social cards sharing web app 

## Social card

It's like "contact address" with social media usernames (Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Phone, etc.)

It can be used to share contacts in less of a minute with anyone using a QR Code.

It is Server 'less (emphasised): It does not send data from users browsers anywhere; Still, users can share their cards.

It just uses URLs and QR Code.

## Example

A link is like this:

https://so-c.me/card.html?bXktYWxpYXMsc2luZmRzZmRzc3RhLHV0b2Rmc2Zkc29iLHd0Zi1hY2Vib29rLHR3YXR0ZmZlcixzbmF0Y2hjaGF0LGdlbWFpbEBnbWFpbC5jb20sMDc3ODY4MDgyNw==@2072760442%1
